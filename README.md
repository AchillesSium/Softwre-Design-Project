This is a prototype of an application which lets user view and compare weather data
from weather stations of their choice.

To run the program the user will need the "Qt Creator" program.
  - Open "Qt creator"
  - Select "Open Project" and find the .pro file found in the project_group_anyone folder.
  - Configure it to run on Qt 5.9.9 MinGW 32bit (Older versions may work if they supprot QtCharts)
  - Make sure a Qt module "QtCharts" is installed. (This can be done via the Qt Maintenance Tool)
  - Build and run the prototype
